# Kruskal's algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees

## Steps
1. Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their weight
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning three formed so far. If not, include this edge. Else, discard it. 
3. Repeat step 2 until there are v-1 edges in the spanning tree. 

$$x-1 = a^2+3x$$
