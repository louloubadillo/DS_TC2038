# Closest pair of points ðŸ”´â†’ðŸ”µ

## Strategy 
- Divide: Draw vertical line L so that n/2 points on each side
- Conquer: Find closes pair in each side recursively
- Combine: Find closes pair with one point in each side
- Return best of 3 solutions

## Optimization 
Find closest pair with one point in each side, assuming that distance < Î´

- Observation: Suffices to consider only those points within Î´ of line L 
- Sort points in 2 Î´-strip by their y-coordinate
- Check distances of only those points within 7 positions in sorted list
