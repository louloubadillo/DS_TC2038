# Divide and Conquer ðŸš©
- Divide up problem into several subproblems of the same kind
- Solve (conquer) each subproblem recursively
- Combine solutions to subproblems into overall solution

## Most common usage
- Divide problems of size n into two subproblems of size n/2
- Solve (conquer) two subproblems recursively 
- Combine two solutions into overall solution

## Consequence
- Brute force: O(n^2)
- Divide and conquer: O(n log n)
