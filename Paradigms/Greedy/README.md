# Greedy Algorithms 
A greedy algorithm constructs a solution to the problem by always making a choice that looks the best at the moment. A greedy algorithm never takes back its choices, but directly constructs the final solution.  For this reason, greedy
algorithms are usually very efficient.<br>
The difficulty in designing greedy algorithms is to find a greedy strategy that always produces an optimal solution to the problem. The locally optimal choices in a greedy algorithm should also be globally optimal. It is often difficult to argue
that a greedy algorithm works.

## Process üîÅ
- Identify safe move
- Prove safety
- Solve subproblem
- Think about optimization and running time

## Optimization üíØ
- Assume everything is somehow sorted
- Which sort order is convenient? 
- Greedy move can be faster after sorting
